        When Cora woke up the next day she was still shocked at the amazing adventure she had the day before.
        She meet such an remarkable character in the Ravenous Beast so she decided to see if she could have
        another exciting day.
        She had just set off on her journey when she met a robot who was crying.
        "What is you name?" asked Cora.
        "My name is Bernard" said the robot.
        "What's the matter?" asked Cora. "Why are you so upset?"
        "I have lost my bottom! I had a great day playing in the park but when I got home, I realised that
        my bottom was missing" said Bernard.
