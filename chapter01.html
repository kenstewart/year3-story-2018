        Chapter 1
    </h1>

    <p>
        This story begins with a girl called Cora who is four years old.
        She is feeling quite bored so she decides to go on an adventure. <br>
        As she starts out on her journey she meets a strange looking character lying in the grass.
        He is moaning and complaining about having a massive pain in his belly.
        When Cora asks him what is wrong he told her he had ate too much...
    </p>
    <p>
        "I have just eaten a little white mouse, a marmalade cat, a spotty dog, a black and white cow,
        a green crocodile, a grinning lion, a big eared elephant and a gigantic whale." he said.<br>
        "Why on earth would you eat all that at once?" asked Cora.<br>
        "Because all of these animals claimed to be the hungriest animals in the world and I had to prove
        to them that no one is hungrier than me. They were all going on about how much they could eat like a red boat,
        a roller skate, a castle, a circus tent, an aeroplane or a pirate's ship among other things so I had to
        show them that I am the hungriest of all." he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cora told him that she thought this was a silly thing to do if it gave him such a big pain in his belly
        but he replied "It is not silly for me because I am the Ravenous Beast and I still have some room
        to fit in a little girl aswell! I will gobble you up and swallow you down!"<br>
        "Now that's what I call hungry!" said Cora as she ran away as fast as she could.
