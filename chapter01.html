        Chapter 1
    </h1>

    <p>
        This story begins with a girl called Cora who is four years old.
        She is feeling quite bored so she decides to go on an adventure.
        As she starts out on her journey she meets a strange looking character lying in the grass.
        He is moaning and complaining about having a massive pain in his belly.
        When Cora asks him what is wrong he told her he had ate too much...
        "I have just eaten a little white mouse, a marmalade cat, a spotty dog, a black and white cow,
        a green crocodile, a grinning lion, a big eared elephant and a gigantic whale." he said.
        "Why on earth would you eat all that at once?" asked Cora.
        "Because all of these animals claimed to be the hungriest animals in the world and I had to prove
        to them that no one is hungrier than me. They were all going on about how much they could eat like a red boat,
        a roller skate, a castle, a circus tent, an aeroplane or a pirate's ship among other things so I had to
        show them that I am the hungriest of all." he replied.
        Cora told him that she thought this was a silly thing to do if it gave him such a big pain in his belly
        but he replied "It is not silly for me because I am the Ravenous Beast and I still have some room
        to fit in a little girl aswell! I will gobble you up and swallow you down!"
        "Now that's what I call hungry!" said Cora as she ran away as fast as she could.
