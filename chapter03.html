        Chapter 3

    <p>
        The next day Cora went on another adventure. She wondered if she would meet any more strange characters or
        make anymore new friends. She really liked the the robot she met yesterday and she was sure they would
        remain friends forever but she hoped she wouldn't meet the Ravenous Beast again as she was scared of him.
