        Chapter 3
    </h1>

    <p>
        The next day Cora went on another adventure. She wondered if she would meet any more strange characters or
        make any more new friends. She really liked the robot she met yesterday and she was sure she would
        remain friends with Bernard forever but she hoped she wouldn't meet the Ravenous Beast again as she was
        scared of him.
        So off Cora set on her journey when she saw a baby sitting on a park bench having just completed the
        Irish Times crossword puzzle.<br>
        "You seem a bit young to be doing a crossword" said Cora.<br>
        "Oh I'm Baby Brains" said the baby. "I'm the smartest baby in the whole world".<br>
        "That sounds very interesting" said Cora. "What makes you the smartest baby in the whole world?"<br>
        "Well, I completed school in just one day and by the time I was two weeks old I had finished studying
        medicine and had started working as a doctor in my local hospital" said Baby Brains.<br>
        "That does sound very smart" said Cora in amazement.<br>
        Just as Baby Brains was about to finish his story about how smart he was, he was interrupted by a loud
        crashing noise. When he turned around to investigate, he saw there was another baby and two monsters
        coming towards them wrecking everything in their path.<br>
        "Oh no!!" exclaimed Baby Brains. "That big monster with the terrible claws, orange eyes and purple
        prickles all over his back is the Gruffalo. We better get out of here as quick as we can."<br>
        "You are right" replied Cora. "The other monster is the Ravenous Beast who will eat us if he catches us
        and worse of all, the baby that is leading them is my brother Conor. You do not want to meet him. He is a
        little terror who is scarier than the two monsters combined."<br>
        And with that, Cora and Baby Brains ran away as fast as their little legs could carry them.
